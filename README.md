# N-Queens-Problem_202401100400141

This repository provides a Python solution to the N-Queens problem using the backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where the task is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. A queen can attack another queen if they are on the same row, column, or diagonal.

This solution demonstrates the use of backtracking, a recursive algorithmic technique used to solve constraint satisfaction problems like this one.
